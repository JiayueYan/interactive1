              Typography is a tool of communication. It must be communication in its most intense form. 
            
            <div class="box">
                The emphasis must be on absolute clarity since this distinguishes the character of our own writing from that of ancient pictographic forms. 
            
            <div class="box">
                Our intellectual relationship to the world is individual-exact (e.g.,this individual-exact relationship is in a state of transition toward a collective-exact orientation). 
            
            <div class="box">
                This is in contrast to the ancient individual-amorphous and later collective- amorphous mode of communication. Therefore priority: unequivocal clarity in all typographical compositions. Legibility-communication must never be impaired by an a priori aesthetics.
