    <P>&nbsp;Typography is a tool of communication. </P>
    <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;It must be communication in its most intense form. </P>
    <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The emphasis must be on absolute clarity since this distinguishes the character of our own writing from that of ancient pictographic forms. </P>
    <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our intellectual relationship to the world is individual-exact (e.g.,this individual-exact relationship is in a state of transition toward a collective-exact orientation). </P>
    <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is in contrast to the ancient individual-amorphous and later collective- amorphous mode of communication. </P>
    <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore priority: unequivocal clarity in all typographical compositions. </P>
    <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Legibility-communication must never be impaired by an a priori aesthetics. </P>
